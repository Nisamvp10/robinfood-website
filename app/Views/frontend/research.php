                                The challenging endeavour of the academy is to promote research and education in the field of orthopaedics, sports medicine and musculoskeletal disorders thereby providing the path to exhibit innovation irrespective of the global strata of any kind. An active research agenda educates and stimulates teaching, offering the latest information and the newest insights directly to the table. Collaborating with faculty on research initiatives equips students with the distinctive viewpoint and analytical abilities required to resolve the challenges of the future. Thus, we are firm and steadfast to pronounce that the program is the best of the brains we offer.

                                This clinical research internship program provides exposure to clinical and in-vitro research in medicine predominantly in the orthopaedic discipline. Interns will be engaged and tutored under a senior researcher, through the process of clinical research from conceptualizing a research study to manuscript writing and submission in a high impact peer reviewed journal. In addition, interns will be participating in journal clubs, CME programs and society meetings of the ortho clubs under Kerala & Tamil Nadu orthopaedic association to get a wide range of knowledge in the musculoskeletal forum.

                                    Increased anxiety and fear. The term cyberchondria can be defined as someone experiencing a high amount of health anxiety from searching symptoms on the internet.

                                    Self-misdiagnosis is also a danger, especially if doing so means not seeking treatment. For example, if a person confidently self-diagnoses their stomach pains as the stomach flu, they may hesitate to believe their doctor’s diagnosis of appendicitis. Misdiagnoses can even be very serious if it results in failure to detect a possible heart attack, stroke, seizure or tumour.

                                <li>
                                    It’s possible that the search results could offer accurate answers about the cause of the person’s symptoms. Or the search might erroneously suggest they’re well on their way to an early death.

                                <li>Try giving Google a set of symptoms, like shortness of breath, light-headedness, dizziness, increased heart rate, and tingling in hands and legs. (This is what you will likely experience if you engage in hyperventilating for two minutes.) You will get a variety of results from Google from those symptoms.
                                </li>

                            The reality is that online self-diagnosis cannot be prevented. But those consulting Dr. Google should be aware of the potential risks, confirm information found online with a health-care provider and ask health-care providers for credible online sources of information about their diagnoses.

                                    Research is the documented intellect of human evolution and the keystone of rational life that expands the boundaries of human understanding and belief. Research, teaching, service and growth complement one another. Therefore, we envision to provide the best quality of life to the people without pain and suffering by revolutionizing the treatments and techniques in musculoskeletal disorders through research that shall empower mankind across and beyond the limits of theoretical perception.

                                    However, the key difference of Googling symptoms is that there is no direct communication with a physician when self-diagnosing online.

                                    While some people may find that self-diagnosing helps them better explain symptoms to their doctor, others may do so because they believe it offers them more control over their health. Some patients may even fear misdiagnosis or medical errors. However, trying to select credible sources and filter out misinformation can be an overwhelming process. Some information found online has little to no credibility. A study focusing on the spread of fake news on social media found that false information travelled faster and wider than the truth.

                                        Increased anxiety and fear. The term cyberchondria can be defined as someone experiencing a high amount of health anxiety from searching symptoms on the internet.

                                        Self-misdiagnosis is also a danger, especially if doing so means not seeking treatment. For example, if a person confidently self-diagnoses their stomach pains as the stomach flu, they may hesitate to believe their doctor’s diagnosis of appendicitis. Misdiagnoses can even be very serious if it results in failure to detect a possible heart attack, stroke, seizure or tumour.

                                        It’s possible that the search results could offer accurate answers about the cause of the person’s symptoms. Or the search might erroneously suggest they’re well on their way to an early death.
    
                                    </li>

                                        Try giving Google a set of symptoms, like shortness of breath, light-headedness, dizziness, increased heart rate, and tingling in hands and legs. (This is what you will likely experience if you engage in hyperventilating for two minutes.) You will get a variety of results from Google from those symptoms.
    
                                    </li>

                                    Many of the search results are very serious. When people performed a Google search for five minutes using these types of symptoms, they felt worse emotionally. They also reported greater health anxiety than people who simply waited for five minutes.

                                    The reality is that online self-diagnosis cannot be prevented. But those consulting Dr. Google should be aware of the potential risks, confirm information found online with a health-care provider and ask health-care providers for credible online sources of information about their diagnoses.
